# Multi-Agent Finance Assistant
I built a multi-agent finance assistant that delivers spoken market briefs via a Streamlit app. It integrates real-time data APIs, web scraping, and RAG with FAISS. Agents are orchestrated using FastAPI, with Whisper for STT and TTS for responses. The system is modular, open-source, and fully deployed.
